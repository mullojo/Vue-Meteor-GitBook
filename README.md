# Vue + Meteor GitBook

![Vue + Meteor Stack at the simplest level](.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

Several very popular open source projects are combined to create Meteor and to then add Vue to a Meteor app as the front-end \(aka view layer\).   Meteor allows developers to chose any popular view layer.

Several core projects are combined to make a Vue + Meteor full-stack, and to a new developer, Meteor handles all of this for you, but it's important to learn about each of these parts.

Meteor has had the most evolution since it's creation, so it's sometimes not clear to new users why Meteor is the right choice for new app development with Vue.  

This book serves to demonstrate the many advantages of using Vue and Meteor together.
