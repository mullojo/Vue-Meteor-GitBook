  Installing Meteor is the first step because Meteor will install Node.js and
  Mongo DB for you on your local machine.

# Install Meteor

## Run Meteor Install Command

Open Terminal and run this command to install the latest version of Meteor

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Create a new Meteor app with any name, replace `my-new-app` with the name of your app

```bash
meteor create my-new-app
```

Or add the `--vue` command to create a Meteor app with Vue packages \(saves some time on future steps\)
